# Dapr Service (Callback) SDK for Go

In addition to this Dapr API client, Dapr go SDK also provides `service` package to bootstrap your Dapr callback services in either gRPC or HTTP:

* [HTTP Service](./http/Readme.md)
* [gRPC Service](./grpc/Readme.md)

## Templates 

To accelerate your Dapr app development in go even further you can use one of the GitHub templates integrating these Dapr callback packages:

* [Dapr gRPC Service in Go](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-grpc-service-template) - Template project to jump start your Dapr event subscriber service with gRPC development
